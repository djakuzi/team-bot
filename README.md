# Project **TeamBot**

## Description

Team Bot - a little helper in your development chat.

## Quick Start 

- Create your bot. See [Created bot](https://docs.radist.online/docs/our-products/radist-web/connections/telegram-bot/instructions-for-creating-and-configuring-a-bot-in-botfather)
- Create an account on [Open Router](https://openrouter.ai) and get your [token](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys). 
- Deploy the project. See [Deployment](https://github.com/djakuzi/team-bot/wiki/Backend.Deployment)

To use the bot, you need to add it to the desired chat and activate it by sending the command /start_auto or through the menu under Bot Settings. After activation, the bot will be accessible only to chat members, ensuring security and access control.

>**Important**: Make sure to assign all necessary roles to the bot in the chat (such as administrator rights) to enable its full functionality — for example, managing messages, reading chat history, and sending notifications.
